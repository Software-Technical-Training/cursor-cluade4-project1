# Phase 3: GCP Deployment Conversation - Started 2025-08-03

## Session 1: Initial GCP Deployment Planning

### User Prompt (Full):
Our next task is to be able to deploy the backend to a new project in my google cloud account directly from my github repo. I asked the gemini AI assistant in my gcp portal and these are the steps it listed. Let me know what parts you can help with in automating and what type of keys or tokens you will need. Goal is to push changes to github and have them be auto-deployed to the gcp prod instance.
Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Google Cloud Project Setup

First, you'll need a new Google Cloud project. This provides a dedicated environment for your application and helps manage resources.

Create a new GCP Project: In the Google Cloud Console, create a new project. Give it a descriptive name.
Enable necessary APIs: For this full-stack application, you'll need to enable several Google Cloud APIs. These typically include:
Cloud Build API (for CI/CD)
Cloud Run API (for hosting the frontend and backend as services) or App Engine API
Cloud SQL API (for your database)
Artifact Registry API (for storing Docker images)
Secret Manager API (for securely storing sensitive information like database credentials)
2. Containerize Your Application (Docker)

For a consistent and scalable deployment, it's best practice to containerize your React frontend and Java Spring backend using Docker.

Dockerfile for React Frontend:
Create a Dockerfile in your React project's root. This file will define how to build a Docker image for your frontend. It typically involves installing dependencies, building the React application, and serving the static files (e.g., using Nginx).
Dockerfile for Java Spring Backend:
Create a Dockerfile in your Spring project's root. This will define how to build a Docker image for your backend. It usually involves building your Spring Boot JAR file and running it within a Java runtime environment.
3. Database Setup (Cloud SQL)

For your database tables, Google Cloud SQL is a managed relational database service that supports various database engines like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

Create a Cloud SQL Instance: In your GCP project, create a new Cloud SQL instance. Choose the database engine that matches your current setup.
Configure Database and Users: Once the instance is provisioned, create your database and users. Configure network access to allow connections from your application.
Migrate Data: You'll need to migrate your existing database tables and data to this Cloud SQL instance.
4. Securely Manage Credentials (Secret Manager)

Your application will need to connect to the database. It's crucial to manage database credentials securely.

Store Secrets in Secret Manager: Use Google Cloud Secret Manager to store sensitive information like database usernames, passwords, and any other API keys. This keeps them out of your code and environment variables.
Grant Access: Ensure your Cloud Run services (or other compute services) have the necessary IAM permissions to access these secrets from Secret Manager.
5. Set up CI/CD Pipeline with Cloud Build

Google Cloud Build is a serverless CI/CD platform that can pull code from GitHub, run builds, and deploy applications.

Connect GitHub Repository:
In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Build.
Connect your personal GitHub repository. You'll authorize Cloud Build to access your GitHub account.
Create cloudbuild.yaml :
In the root of your GitHub repository, create a cloudbuild.yaml file. This file defines the steps Cloud Build will execute.
Build Steps: Your cloudbuild.yaml will likely include steps to:
Build the React Docker image and push it to Artifact Registry.
Build the Java Spring Docker image and push it to Artifact Registry.
Optional: Run unit tests for both frontend and backend.
Deployment Steps: After successful builds, the cloudbuild.yaml will deploy the new Docker images. You have a few options for deploying your services:
Cloud Run (Recommended for simple full-stack apps): Deploy your React frontend and Java Spring backend as separate services on Cloud Run. Cloud Run automatically handles scaling and provides a public URL for each service.
App Engine: Another Platform as a Service (PaaS) option. You can deploy your frontend and backend as separate services within App Engine.
Create Cloud Build Triggers:
In the Cloud Build section of the GCP Console, create triggers that watch for changes in your GitHub repository (e.g., pushes to the main branch).
Configure the trigger to use your cloudbuild.yaml file to define the build steps.
6. Public URL and Connectivity

Cloud Run / App Engine URLs: If you deploy to Cloud Run or App Engine, each service will automatically be assigned a public URL.
Frontend-Backend Communication: Your React frontend will need to know the public URL of your Java Spring backend. You can manage this using environment variables that are injected into your React application during the build process or at runtime.
Database Connectivity: Your Java Spring backend will connect to your Cloud SQL instance. Ensure the backend is configured with the correct Cloud SQL connection string and uses the credentials from Secret Manager.

### Assistant's Planned Summary:

I will help automate the GCP deployment process for the Grocery Automation backend. Here's my planned approach:

#### What I Can Automate:

1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Create Dockerfile for Spring Boot backend
   - Create .dockerignore file
   - Optimize Docker build for Java applications

2. **Cloud Build Pipeline**

   - Set up monitoring and alerts

4. **Phase 4: Production Readiness**
   - Configure custom domain (if needed)
   - Set up SSL certificates
   - Configure autoscaling
   - Implement logging and monitoring

This approach will enable automatic deployment to GCP whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository's main branch.

### User Follow-up:
Let me first gather the credntials needed and do this is in small steps and not all at once. Tell me what you need from my GCP account as a first step.

### Assistant Response - First Step Requirements:

For the first step, we'll focus on setting up the GCP project and creating a service account with the minimal permissions needed to get started. Here's what you need to do:

## Step 1: GCP Project Setup

### 1. Create or Select a GCP Project
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- Create a new project or select an existing one
- **What I need from you**: The Project ID (not the project name)
  - You can find this in the project selector dropdown or in Project Settings
  - It looks like: `my-grocery-app-123456`

### 2. Enable Required APIs
For now, let's enable just the essential APIs we'll need for the backend deployment:

In the GCP Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Enable APIs and Services" and enable:
1. **Cloud Run API** - For hosting the backend
2. **Cloud Build API** - For CI/CD pipeline
3. **Artifact Registry API** - For storing Docker images
4. **Secret Manager API** - For storing sensitive data

### 3. Create a Service Account
1. Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Name it something like `grocery-app-deployer`
4. For now, grant these basic roles:
   - **Cloud Run Developer** - To deploy to Cloud Run
   - **Cloud Build Editor** - To run builds
   - **Artifact Registry Writer** - To push Docker images
   - **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** - To read secrets

### 4. Create and Download Service Account Key
1. After creating the service account, click on it
2. Go to the "Keys" tab
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
4. Choose JSON format
5. Download and save this file securely (we'll need it later)

### What to Provide Me:
1. **Project ID**: `your-project-id`
2. **Preferred Region**: (e.g., `us-central1`, `us-east1`, `europe-west1`)
3. **Confirmation** that you've:
   - Enabled the 4 APIs listed above
   - Created the service account with the roles
   - Downloaded the JSON key file

Once you have these ready, we can proceed to create the Docker configuration for your backend, which we can test locally before deploying to GCP.

### User Question:
It is asking me if I want to optionally add principals while i am creating my service account. Do I need to fill this ?

### Assistant Response:
No, you don't need to fill in the "Principals with access" section. This is optional and you can skip it.

**Explanation:**
- The "Permissions" step (step 2) is where you grant roles TO the service account (what the service account can do)
- The "Principals with access" step (step 3) is where you would grant other users/accounts access to USE this service account
- Since this is your personal project, you don't need to grant anyone else access to use this service account

Just click "Done" to complete the service account creation. After that, you'll need to:
1. Click on the newly created service account
2. Go to the "Keys" tab
3. Create and download the JSON key file

### User Follow-up:
I have created service account. Do I need add something in Manage access ? Also how do i generate the json key for this account

### Assistant Response:
No, you don't need to click "Manage access". You've already assigned the necessary roles during the service account creation.

To generate the JSON key:
1. Click on the **"Keys"** tab (visible in your screenshot)
2. Click **"ADD KEY"** → **"Create new key"**
3. Select **"JSON"** format
4. Click **"CREATE"**
5. The file will download automatically - keep it secure!

**Important**: This JSON key file is sensitive - it's like a password for your service account. Store it securely and never commit it to Git.

### User Confirmation - GCP Setup Complete:
Ok here are all the details for the steps I have completed so far. The 4 essential apis are also enabled. The json key file is in the root folder of this project. 
Project name: grocery-automation
Project number: 952204582614
Project ID: grocery-automation-467922
Service account: grocery-app-deployer
Service account email: grocery-app-deployer@grocery-automation-467922.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Unique ID: 104732777342026411918

### Assistant Response - Next Steps:

Great! You've completed the GCP setup. Now let's:

1. First, secure your JSON key file by adding it to .gitignore
2. Create the Docker configuration for your Spring Boot backend
3. Test it locally before deploying to Cloud Run

Let's start:

### Docker Setup Created:

1. **Added to .gitignore**: Added JSON key file patterns to prevent accidental commits
2. **Created Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build for optimized Spring Boot container
3. **Created .dockerignore**: To exclude unnecessary files from Docker build
4. **Created application-cloud.properties**: Cloud-specific configuration

### Docker Not Installed:

Docker is not installed on your machine. To proceed with containerization and deployment, you need to:

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Mac**: 
   - Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Download Docker Desktop for Mac
   - Install and start Docker Desktop

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker run hello-world
   ```

Once Docker is installed, we can:
- Build and test the container locally
- Push it to Google Artifact Registry
- Deploy to Cloud Run

Would you like to:
1. Install Docker now and continue, or
2. Skip local testing and deploy directly using Cloud Build (which builds in the cloud)?

### User Update:
I have installed docker desktop

### Assistant Response - Testing Docker Build:

Great! Let's verify Docker is working and build the container locally.

### Docker Build Success:

1. **Fixed Docker PATH issue** - Docker Desktop was installed but not in PATH
2. **Built Docker image successfully** - Using multi-stage build for optimized size
3. **Tested container locally** - Running on port 8080 with cloud profile
4. **Container is healthy** - Application started successfully in Docker

The Docker container is now running at http://localhost:8080 with:
- Spring profile: cloud
- Using H2 in-memory database (will migrate to Cloud SQL later)
- Health check endpoint working

### Next Step: Setting up Google Artifact Registry

Now that we've verified the Docker container works locally, let's set up Google Artifact Registry to store our Docker images in GCP.

### User Continues Setup

### Assistant Response - Artifact Registry Setup:

I've created detailed instructions in `backend/gcp-setup-instructions.md` for setting up Artifact Registry.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Docker container built and tested locally
- ✅ Container running successfully on port 8080
- ⏳ Need to create Artifact Registry repository in GCP Console

**Next Actions Required:**

1. **Create Artifact Registry Repository**
   - Go to the GCP Console Artifact Registry page
   - Create a new Docker repository named `grocery-automation-backend`
   - Choose your preferred region

2. **Provide the Region**
   - Once you've created the repository, tell me which region you selected
   - I'll then create authentication scripts to push the image

**Note:** Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) is not installed on your machine. We'll use Docker authentication helpers as a workaround.

### User Update - Installing Google Cloud SDK:
I'm trying to install the google cloud sdk and am getting some errors.

### Assistant Response - Fixing gcloud Installation:

I see you're encountering SSL certificate errors during the Google Cloud SDK installation. This is a common issue on macOS. Let me provide you with solutions:

## Solutions Provided:

### Option 1: Install via Homebrew (Recommended)
If you have Homebrew installed, run:
```bash
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

### Option 2: Use the Installation Script
I've created `backend/install-gcloud.sh` that handles the installation with SSL workarounds.

### Option 3: Skip gcloud Installation (Proceed without it)
I've created scripts that work WITHOUT gcloud:

1. **`docker-auth-helper.sh`** - Authenticates Docker with Artifact Registry using your service account key
2. **`push-to-registry.sh`** - Tags and pushes your Docker image to Artifact Registry

## To Proceed WITHOUT gcloud:

1. First, create the Artifact Registry repository in GCP Console (as per the instructions)
2. Tell me which region you selected
3. Run: `./push-to-registry.sh <your-region>`

This approach uses your service account JSON key directly for authentication, bypassing the need for gcloud CLI.

### User Update - Artifact Registry Created:
Lets go with Option 3. I have created the artifiact registry with the name you indicated and used us-west-2 as region

### Assistant Response - Pushing to Artifact Registry:

Great! You've created the Artifact Registry repository in `us-west2`. Let's push your Docker image to it.

### Successful Push to Artifact Registry:

✅ **Image successfully pushed!**
- Image URL: `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/grocery-automation-467922/grocery-automation-backend/backend:latest`
- Registry: us-west2
- Repository: grocery-automation-backend

### Next Step: Deploy to Cloud Run

I've created:
1. **`cloud-run-deploy.yaml`** - Cloud Run service configuration
2. **`cloud-run-deployment-instructions.md`** - Step-by-step deployment guide

The instructions include:
- Detailed steps for deploying via Google Cloud Console
- Configuration settings for the service
- Environment variables needed
- Post-deployment testing steps

### User Error - Architecture Mismatch:
Got error Failed. Details: Cloud Run does not support image 'us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/grocery-automation-467922/grocery-automation-backend/backend@sha256:e95c43ce4fae20206d8646e5813d9887e75ce4ee39aad2ea49cde8036f3a6698': Container manifest type 'application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json' must support amd64/linux.

### Assistant Response - Fixing Architecture Issue:

The issue is that the Docker image was built for ARM64 (Apple Silicon) but Cloud Run requires AMD64 architecture. Let me build a multi-platform image.

### Solution - Built AMD64 Image:

Created `build-for-cloudrun.sh` script that builds specifically for AMD64 architecture.

✅ **Successfully built and pushed AMD64 image!**
- Image URL: `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/grocery-automation-467922/grocery-automation-backend/backend:latest`
- Architecture: linux/amd64 (Cloud Run compatible)
- Ready for deployment!

### User Update - Successful Deployment:
Its saying PORT is a reserved variable. I don't need to add it as a variable as the default port for container is 8080. Anyway it has successfully deployed it. Are we ready to test the swagger ui using public URL now for the REST endpoints ? Lets do the github integration later.

### Assistant Response - Testing Deployed API:

Excellent! Your backend is successfully deployed to Cloud Run! 🎉

You're correct - PORT is automatically set by Cloud Run, so we don't need to add it manually.

### User Update - CORS Error:
This is cloud run url @https://backend-952204582614.us-west2.run.app but I am getting an error when i try to execute one of the REST apis. Failed to fetch. Possible Reasons: CORS Network Failure URL scheme must be "http" or "https" for CORS request.

### Assistant Response - Fixing CORS:

[Previous CORS fix implementation details were here]

## Phase 3 Continuation - CI/CD and Database Migration

### User Request - August 3, 2024:
Continuing on our phase 3 of deploying the backend for this grocery automation project to gcp, we need to complete the following tasks in sequence. Follow the cursor rules. Start a new session for our prompts and conversations. I want you to plan first and then let me review and then execute as mentioned in cursor rules. We need to a) complete the automation of the gcp deployment to deploy a new image automatically everytime there is an update to the github repo for this project. and b) change the database from in memory to an actual cloud based db in gcp. Plan the first step now

### Assistant Response - Planning CI/CD Automation:

I've created a comprehensive plan for implementing CI/CD automation and database migration. Here's the overview:

## Plan Summary

### Part A: Automated Deployment Pipeline (Today's Focus)
We'll set up Google Cloud Build to automatically build and deploy your backend to Cloud Run whenever you push code to the main branch of your GitHub repository.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Enable Cloud Build API** and configure service account permissions
2. **Create cloudbuild.yaml** - This file will define the build steps:
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to Artifact Registry  
   - Deploy to Cloud Run
3. **Connect GitHub Repository** to Cloud Build
4. **Create a build trigger** for the main branch
5. **Test the pipeline** with a sample commit

### Part B: Database Migration (Next Session)
We'll migrate from the H2 in-memory database to Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Create Cloud SQL instance** (PostgreSQL 15)
2. **Update application** with PostgreSQL dependencies and configuration
3. **Configure Cloud Run** to connect to Cloud SQL
4. **Migrate data** and test all endpoints

## Implementation Approach for Today

I recommend we start with the CI/CD automation first because:
1. It will make future deployments automatic (including the database changes)
2. It's less disruptive to the current running application
3. We can test it incrementally

### First Step: Create cloudbuild.yaml
I'll create a Cloud Build configuration file that:
- Uses your existing Dockerfile
- Builds for the correct architecture (linux/amd64)
- Pushes to your Artifact Registry
- Deploys to your existing Cloud Run service

### Required Permissions
Before we start, we need to ensure Cloud Build has the right permissions:
- Cloud Run Admin
- Service Account User  
- Artifact Registry Writer

Would you like me to proceed with creating the cloudbuild.yaml file and guide you through setting up the necessary permissions? This will be our first concrete step toward automating your deployments.

### User Update:
You have already created a cloudbuild.yaml file and its in the gcp folder. Do you plan to update it ? Can you first check it and let me know what needs to be modified there

### Assistant Response - Creating cloudbuild.yaml:

I checked the gcp folder but couldn't find a cloudbuild.yaml file. The cloud-run-deploy.yaml is a different file (it's a Kubernetes-style service configuration for Cloud Run).

I've now created a new `cloudbuild.yaml` file in the `backend/` directory. Here's what this configuration does:

## Cloud Build Configuration Overview

### Build Pipeline Steps:

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   - Uses the Dockerfile from the `gcp/` folder
   - Builds for linux/amd64 architecture (Cloud Run compatible)
   - Tags with both commit SHA and 'latest'

2. **Push to Artifact Registry**:
   - Pushes all tags to your existing registry
   - Location: `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/grocery-automation-467922/grocery-automation-backend/`

3. **Deploy to Cloud Run**:
   - Deploys to your existing service: `grocery-automation-backend`
   - Maintains all your current settings (2 CPU, 2Gi memory, 1-10 instances)
   - Sets SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=cloud

### Key Configuration Features:
- **Substitution variables**: Easy to modify settings without changing the file
- **Proper dependencies**: Each step waits for the previous one
- **Version tracking**: Every deployment is tagged with Git commit SHA
- **Rollback ready**: Can easily revert to any previous version

### File Location:
The cloudbuild.yaml is placed in the `backend/` directory (not in `gcp/`) because:
- Cloud Build looks for it at the repository root or in the build context directory
- The build context needs to include both source code and the Dockerfile

Would you like me to walk you through setting up the Cloud Build trigger to use this configuration?

### User Request:
Can you create all gcp related files in gcp folder. Move this file there and make any necessary path changes

### Assistant Response - Moving cloudbuild.yaml to gcp folder:

Done! I've moved the cloudbuild.yaml to the `backend/gcp/` folder and updated the necessary paths. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Moved the file**: `backend/cloudbuild.yaml` → `backend/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml`

2. **Updated Dockerfile path**: Changed from `gcp/Dockerfile` to `backend/gcp/Dockerfile` since Cloud Build runs from the repository root

3. **Removed the `dir` directive**: The build now runs from the repository root and uses full paths

4. **Created setup instructions**: Added `cloud-build-setup-instructions.md` with detailed steps

## File Organization:
All GCP-related files are now in `backend/gcp/`:
- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Cloud Build configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Docker build configuration
- `cloud-build-setup-instructions.md` - Setup guide
- All deployment scripts and other GCP files

## Important Note:
When you create the Cloud Build trigger, you'll need to specify the configuration file location as:
```
/backend/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml
```

The build process will:
1. Run from your repository root
2. Use the Dockerfile at `backend/gcp/Dockerfile`
3. Build the backend directory contents
4. Deploy to Cloud Run

Ready to proceed with setting up the Cloud Build trigger in your GCP console?

### User Update - Testing Build Trigger:
Lets test the build trigger first. push all uncommitted changes and then wait for me to confirm if the build got triggered

### Assistant Response - Pushing Changes:
I've pushed all the changes to trigger the build. The commit includes cloudbuild.yaml, setup instructions, and the CI/CD plan.

### User Update - Permission Error:
The service account running this build projects/grocery-automation-467922/serviceAccounts/grocery-app-deployer@grocery-automation-467922.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have permission to write logs to Cloud Logging. To fix this, grant the Logs Writer (roles/logging.logWriter) role to the service account.

### Assistant Response - Fixing Permissions:

The build is failing because the grocery-app-deployer service account needs the Logs Writer permission. I've updated the setup instructions to include this permission.

### User Update - Build Success:
Yes it got deployed. Looks like we have the full automated build setup running. What did you want to do next ?

### Assistant Response - Database Migration Planning:

Excellent! The CI/CD pipeline is working. I recommend setting up Cloud SQL PostgreSQL next to replace the H2 in-memory database.

### User Confirmation:
Yes lets setup prod db

### Assistant Response - Cloud SQL Setup:
