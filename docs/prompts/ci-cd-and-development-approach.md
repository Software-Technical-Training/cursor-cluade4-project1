# CI/CD and Development Approach Conversation
Date: July 12, 2025

## User Prompt 1:
Before we start getting into coding I want you to check this current github repo to see how to run the Travis CI to GCP. I believe these two apps (Travis CI and Google Cloud) are available in my repo but I don't know how to use them

## Summary:
- Checked repository for CI/CD configuration - found no Travis CI config files
- Discovered Google Cloud Build is available as a GitHub App in the repository settings
- User has access to the settings page showing Google Cloud Build needs configuration

## User Prompt 2:
Ok I don't need you to create any guide. I just asked you to check. I can see that Google Cloud Build app is available in my repo. I need to configure it. Just let me know if you know how to configure it. I don't need any detailed steps right now. I just need to understand how we will push our application to GCP as we start building it. Can you briefly explain that

## Summary:
Provided brief explanation of Google Cloud Build workflow:
- Automatic triggers on GitHub pushes
- Uses cloudbuild.yaml for build configuration
- Deploys frontend to Firebase Hosting
- Deploys backend to Cloud Run
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline integrated with GCP

## User Prompt 3:
Ok great. I will ask you to help me later to configure and deploy. For now , I want to understand what's the best way to get started. I want to initially just try things out locally and I don't want to build everything in one shot. Should we start with some type of in memory storage and define the DB objects first ? Then do we build the service layer to talk to this DB and test that out ? Then followed by React web app ? Suggest the best approach which we can do step by step

## Summary:
Recommended phased development approach:
- Phase 1: Spring Boot with H2 in-memory database, define entities
- Phase 2: Mock sensor data and business logic
- Phase 3: Basic React UI
- Phase 4: Integration and polish (auth, Maps, PostgreSQL)
- Phase 5: Cloud deployment with Docker and Cloud Build

## User Prompt 4:
I noticed you have stopped saving my prompts and your summaries. Why is that ?

## Summary:
User correctly noticed I wasn't following the .cursorrules requirement to save prompts and summaries. Apologized and created this documentation file to capture the conversation.

## User Prompt 5:
Before we proceed with Ph1 , how would I test it ? Will you be adding some kind of mock responses to both the REST and GQL endpoints and provide with me with some kind of interface to run them and see the responses ?

## Summary:
Explained testing approach for Phase 1:
- Will build real working endpoints with H2 in-memory database, not just mocks
- Multiple testing interfaces: H2 Console, Swagger UI, Spring Boot Actuator
- Will provide seed data, test scenarios, Postman collection
- Mock sensor service to generate realistic data
- Showed example of expected API responses

## User Prompt 6:
Proceed with Phase 1 implementation

## Summary:
Completed Phase 1 implementation:
- Created Spring Boot project with H2 database and all dependencies
- Implemented all core entities (User, Device, Store, GroceryItem, InventoryItem, Order, OrderItem)
- Created JPA repositories with custom queries
- Built REST controllers (UserController, InventoryController) with Swagger documentation
- Implemented services (UserService, InventoryService) with business logic
- Added DataSeeder for automatic test data population
- Created MockSensorService to simulate inventory consumption
- Configured Swagger UI for API testing
- Created comprehensive README with testing instructions
- Added Maven wrapper for easy execution
