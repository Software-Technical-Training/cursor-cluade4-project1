# Phase 2 Test Plan Summary

## Overall Structure
- **Directory Layout**: Tests organized under `backend/src/test/java/com/groceryautomation/` with subfolders for `unit/`, `integration/`, `component/`, `util/`, and `config/`.
- **Coverage Goal**: 80% overall (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% component).
- **Tools**: JUnit5 for test running, Mockito for mocking, AssertJ for assertions, Spring Boot Test annotations (e.g., `@SpringBootTest`, `@DataJpaTest`).
- **Execution**: Tests grouped by layer; run via Maven (`mvn test`); CI integration planned for later phases.

## Types of Tests
- **Unit Tests**: Isolate individual classes (e.g., mock dependencies); focus on business logic, edge cases, and exceptions.
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions (e.g., with real DB context); verify data flow and transactions.
- **Component Tests**: End-to-end workflows within the backend (e.g., using MockMvc for API flows).

## Test Groups by Layer/Component
- **Controllers** (e.g., `UserController`, `DeviceController`):
  - Unit: Request validation, response mapping, HTTP status handling.
  - Integration: Full API requests, error responses.
- **Services** (e.g., `UserServiceImpl`, `InventoryServiceImpl`):
  - Unit: Core logic (registration, inventory updates), mocking repositories.
  - Integration: Real DB interactions for state changes.
  - Key Groups: One test class per service, covering happy paths, errors, and mocks.
- **Repositories** (e.g., `UserRepository`):
  - Integration: Query methods, persistence, constraints.
- **Entities** (e.g., `User`, `InventoryItem`):
  - Unit: Validation, helper methods (e.g., status calculations).
- **DTOs** (e.g., `UserRegistrationRequest`):
  - Unit: Validation constraints, serialization.
- **Workflows** (e.g., registration flow, order creation):
  - Component: End-to-end scenarios like user registration + device setup.

## Key Scenarios and Best Practices
- Cover: Happy paths, edge cases (e.g., duplicates, invalid data), exceptions.
- Data Management: Use factories/builders for test data; clean up after tests.
- Adherence: One assertion per test, descriptive names (e.g., `shouldRegisterUserSuccessfully`), independent tests.
- Phases: Start with core services, then controllers/repositories, finally workflows.
